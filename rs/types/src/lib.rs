//! This crate contains assorted types that other component crates
//! depend upon.  The only types that should be included in this crate
//! should be the ones that more than one component crate share.
//! This should generally imply that the types used here should also
//! be getting used in the `interfaces` crate although there might be
//! exceptions to this rule.

// Note [ExecutionRound vs Height]
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//
// A batch received by Message Routing has some `Height` `h` attached to it.
// Once the batch is received, Message Routing needs to retrieve the `State`
// at `Height` `h-1` as a base for the current `ExecutionRound` `h`.
// After `ExecutionRound` `h` is complete, the resulting `State` is going to be
// marked with `Height` `h`.
//
// The main reason to have 2 different types and not use a single one is that
// each type is meaningful in a specific context and represents slightly
// different ideas which cannot always be mapped 1-1 to each other. More
// concretely, `ExecutionRound` which is triggered by batch `Height` `h`
// might process messages that were introduced in previous batch `Height`s.
//
// Furthermore, different subcomponents should have different
// capabilities.  E.g. Message Routing is allowed to
// increment/decrement `Height`s while the Scheduler is not supposed
// to perform any arithmetics on `ExecutionRound`.

// Note [Scheduler and AccumulatedPriority]
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//
// Public Specification of IC describes `compute_allocation`. Each canister is
// initiated with an `accumulated_priority` of 0. The scheduler uses these values
// while calculating the priority of a canister at each round. The canisters
// are scheduled at each round in the following way:
//
// * For each canister, we compute the `round_priority` of that canister as the
// sum of its `accumulated_priority` and the multiplication of its
// `compute_allocation` with the `multiplier` (see the scheduler).
// * We distribute the free capacity equally to all the canisters.
// * For new executions:
//   - We sort the canisters according to their round priorities in
//     descending order.
// * For pending long executions:
//   - Sort the canisters first according to their execution mode,
//     and then round priorities.
//   - Calculate how many scheduler cores we dedicate for long executions
//     in this round using compute allocations of these long executions.
//   - The first `long_execution_cores` many canisters are given the top
//     priority in this round and get into the prioritized long execution mode.
//   - The rest of the long executions are given an opportunity to be executed
//     by scheduling them at the very end.
// * The first `scheduler_cores` many canisters are given the top priority in
// this round. Therefore, they are expected to be executed as the first of
// their threads.
// * As the last step, we credit the first `scheduler_cores` canisters
//   with the sum of compute allocations of all canisters times `multiplier`
//   divided by the number of canisters that are given top priority in
//   this round. This `priority_credit` will be subtracted from the
//   `accumulated_priority` at the end of the execution or at the checkpoint.
//
// As a result, at each round, the sum of accumulated priorities minus
// the sum of priority credits remains 0.
// Similarly, the sum of all round priorities equals to the multiplication of
// the sum of all compute allocations with the multiplier.
