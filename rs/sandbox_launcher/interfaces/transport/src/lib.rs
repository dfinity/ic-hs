/// Transport component API
/// The Transport component provides peer-to-peer connectivity with other peers.
/// It exposes an interface for sending and receiving messages from peers, as well
/// as for tracking the state of connections.
/// The provided interface does not have the notion of clients and servers, as
/// in peer to peer networks, there is no such definition of clients and servers.
/// Therefore, Transport hides these semantics from the components above it
/// (which are called 'Transport clients').

    /// Sets an event handler object that is called when a new message is received.
    /// It is important to call this method before `start_connection`, otherwise,
    /// a panic may occur due to the missing `event_handler`.
    ///
    /// Alternatives considered:
    ///     1. Event handler instance per connection instead per Transport object.
    ///        Having different event handlers per connection/peer implies peers are not equal.
    ///     2. Use a pull model for delivering message to the Transport `client`.
    ///        In this context the Transport `client` is the service/library that consumes the
    ///        received messages.
    ///        One way to implement this is to return channel receiver(s) when a connection
    ///        is established. Then the client can pull the receiver(s) to consume messages.
    ///        Using a pull model leads to:
    ///             a) can't have custom logic like filtering, load shedding, queueing,
    ///                rate-limitting, etc. before messages are deliver to the client
    ///             b) complicated concurrent processing, because messages are fanned in into
    ///                a single channel that the client uses to receive them
    ///                (channel receivers require exclusive access to receive a message).
