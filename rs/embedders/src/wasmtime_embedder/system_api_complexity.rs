/// The Fixed System API Overhead (in Instructions)

/// The cost of the System API calls is proportional to the work the call performs.
/// The cost consists of two parts: fixed and variable. The fixed part accounts for
/// the overhead of performing the call in WebAssembly. The variable part depends
/// on the parameters of the call (i.e. number of bytes).
///
/// The fixed System API overhead represented in WebAssembly Instructions. This
/// overhead will be added to the total Instructions executed by Canisters, and
/// hence will be later proxied to the computation costs in Cycles as the normal
/// WebAssembly instructions.
///
/// See `EXECUTE_UPDATE.md` for more details.

/// execute for 251ms. So a single system call roughly takes `251ms/1M = 251ns`
/// Basically, the number from the table in milliseconds per 1M calls roughly equals
